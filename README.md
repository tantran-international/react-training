__GETTING STARTED :__  

BUILD TOOL  

We use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) which is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.  

HELLO WORLD  

If you have pnpm installed already, letâ€™s start your first project using pnpm and vite. You can either choose template as react, or react-ts if you want to init with TypeScript. From your terminal, run: 

- pnpm create vite my-react-app -- --template react-ts
- Install and run on local
- cd my-react-app
- pnpm install
- pnpm dev  

Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 

Try modifying your React component and see how it changes.  

If you are using VS Code and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), make sure you installed extension  [Remote - WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl)

STORYBOOK  

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is an open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing and documentation.

Init storybook into your first React app:  
- init storybook:
  - pnpx sb init -s
- install dependencies:
  - pnpm install
- run it
  - pnpm storybook

Try to create a Storybook for your example components.
